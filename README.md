# Indian 2024 Lok Sabha Elections Analysis

This project analyzes the 2024 Indian Lok Sabha elections using Python libraries like NumPy, pandas, and seaborn. The goal is to explore election data, visualize trends, and derive insights into voting patterns, party performance, and specific key metrics such as margin of victory, vote distribution, and candidate comparisons.


## Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the 2024 Indian general elections, focusing on party performance, vote distribution, and candidate comparisons. It explores electoral data to uncover trends such as the number of seats won by each party, vote comparison between prominent political leaders, and margins of victory.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Election results by state and constituency
- Candidate performance data
- Party-wise vote and seat distribution
- Margin of victory for all candidates

You can find the dataset [here](link_to_dataset).

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language used.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and analysis.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **seaborn**: For creating visualizations.



## Exploratory Data Analysis
We conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the election results, with a focus on:
- Identifying the number of seats won by each political party.
- Comparing vote counts for prominent leaders like Rahul Gandhi, Narendra Modi, and Amit Shah.
- Analyzing the candidates with the highest and lowest margin of victory.
- Understanding the overall vote distribution across parties.

## Key Analyses
The project focused on the following key aspects:
1. **Number of Seats Won by Each Party**: A breakdown of how many seats each political party secured.
   
2. **Comparison of Votes for Key Leaders**: Analysis comparing the vote counts for Rahul Gandhi, Narendra Modi, and Amit Shah across different constituencies.

3. **Candidate with Highest and Lowest Margin of Victory**: Identifying the candidates who won with the largest and smallest margins of victory, highlighting electoral dynamics.

4. **Histogram of Margin of Victory**: A distribution plot showing the spread of margins of victory across all candidates.

5. **Votes Distribution of Political Parties**: Analyzing how votes were distributed among various parties, providing insights into overall electoral preferences.

6. **Top 1 Trailing Parties by Seats and Votes**: A closer look at the parties that trailed the winners, comparing their seat and vote shares.


## Conclusion
The analysis provides a comprehensive view of the 2024 Lok Sabha election results, highlighting key trends such as the performance of major political figures, party vote distributions, and the margins of victory. The findings shed light on how different demographics and regions impacted the election outcomes.

## Future Scope
- Expanding the analysis by incorporating additional demographic data to better understand voting behavior.
- Using predictive models to forecast future election outcomes based on past trends.
